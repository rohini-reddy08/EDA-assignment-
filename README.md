Insights Derived
1. Price Distribution
House prices show significant variation across regions, with metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Bangalore showing the highest averages.
The price distribution is positively skewed, indicating that most houses fall in the lower to mid-range price brackets.
2. Impact of Location
Prime locations (e.g., city centers) exhibit higher price per square foot compared to suburban or rural areas.
Certain neighborhoods have premium pricing due to proximity to schools, hospitals, or business hubs.
3. Size vs. Price Relationship
Larger properties tend to have higher prices, but the price per square foot decreases as the property size increases.
Compact houses (1-2 BHK) are in high demand in metropolitan areas due to affordability and urban lifestyle preferences.
4. Impact of Amenities
Properties with modern amenities like swimming pools, gyms, and security systems command a higher price.
Parking availability is a critical factor in determining house prices in urban areas.
5. Year Built
Recently constructed houses (post-2015) tend to be priced higher due to contemporary designs and compliance with modern building standards.
